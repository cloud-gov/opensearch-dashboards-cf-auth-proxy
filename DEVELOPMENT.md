# Development

## Getting started

Most development-related tasks are exposed in the `dev` script. To just get started developing:

```shell
./dev set-up-environment
```

This command will set up an environment for you. This does not touch anything outside of this repository.

To see all of the available commands, run `./dev -h`.

## Code style

Code is styled with `black`, which is configured in `pyproject.toml`. This means you can (and
should) simply run `black` before committing, and everything will automagically be formatted consistently.

## Managing requirements

Requirements are managed with `pip-compile`.

To add a new package to the environment:

- add the loosest-version constraint to `pip-tools/requirements.in` (or `pip-tools/dev-requirements.in`
if it's a development requirement)
- Run this commmand:

    ```shell
    ./dev update-requirements
    ```

To update `requirements.txt` and `dev-requirements.txt` from current contents of `pip-tools/dev-requirements.in` and `pip-tools/requirements.in`:

  ```shell
  ./dev update-requirements
  ```

To upgrade the packages in `requirements.txt` and `dev-requirements.txt` based on the version constraints in `pip-tools/dev-requirements.in` and `pip-tools/requirements.in`:

  ```shell
  ./dev upgrade-requirements
  ```
