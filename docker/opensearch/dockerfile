# we're building this image to run on Cloud Foundry, where we can
# only have one port exposed. The upstream exposes more than one,
# and docker doesn't provide a direct method to override it.
# so, we're using the opensearch image as a "builder" and then copying
# everything into scratch, which is a blank image ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
